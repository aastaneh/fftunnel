h4. Install Your SSH Public Key on the Remote Host

If you don't know how to do this, there are many online guides available to show you how.

<pre>
$ fftunnel user@server (additional options)
</pre>

Since this wraps around the ssh binary, you can use options such as '-p' to specify port.

Have Fun!
